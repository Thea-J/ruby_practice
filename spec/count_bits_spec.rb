#Challenge: 
# Write a method that accepts a non-negative integer
# Calculates the binary representation of that integer
# Returns the count of the bits (1's) in the binary representation

#Requirements:
# Main cases: +ve integer
# Edge cases: integer 0, 
             #integer whose binary representation is only 0's, 
             #integer whose binary representation is only 1's
